Hello!

This is a VERY WIP thing i'm making for Kiwi IRC

my end goal is to have something that makes it easy to make plugins for kiwi

Why?

Science isn't about WHY. It's about WHY NOT. Why is so much of our science dangerous? Why not marry safe science if you love it so much. In fact, why not invent a special safety door that won't hit you on the butt on the way out, because you are fired. - Cave Johnson






(dont mind this, just some stuff)

exports > res > autocompletecommands
- neat thing. can edit those to change the autocomplete, add alias autocompleter?

window.kiwi.emit("input.raw", "test")

sends "test" in the active channel
